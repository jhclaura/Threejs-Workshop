# Three.js Workshop, 2015
------


[let's use localhost to serve the page!]

0. git clone OR download as ZIP
1. open Terminal
2. go into directory:
  1. cd 
  2. drag folder/directory into Terminal
  3. enter
3. python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
4. Open browser and type localhost:8000

This opens the html file with template.js. In there you can add custom elements, e.g. camera, lights, mesh etc.
Change the script link in html file from "template.js" to "script.js", then you can see what we made in the workshop, which is a rotation cube! Woohoo!
