  1. cd 
  2. drag folder/directory into Terminal
  3. enter

Default the HTML page is linked with template_0X.js. In there you can add custom elements, e.g. camera, lights, mesh, in the workshop with specific topic.
Change the script link in HTML file from "template_0X.js" to "script_0X.js", then you can see what it is made in the specific workshop.
